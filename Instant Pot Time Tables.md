## Seafood and Fish

Steaming in a bowl with a trivet, 1 cup of water underneath, is the preferred method. Almost all seafood will use steam release to avoid overcooking.

| Seafood and Fish  | Fresh, Minutes    | Frozen, Minutes   |
|:------------------|:------------------|:------------------|
| Crab              | 3-4               | 5-6               |
| Fish, whole       | 5-6               | 7-10              |
| Fish, filet       | 2-3               | 3-4               |
| Lobster           | 3-4               | 4-6               |
| Mussels           | 2-3               | 4-5               |
| Shrimp            | 1-2               | 2-3               |

## Rice and Grains

Approximately 1/2 cup dried grain is one adult serving. Turn off heat and steam release to avoid overcooking.

## Dried Legumes

Dried beans double in size, so don't fill the pot more than half full. Use enough liquid to cover the beans. Beans are easy to undercook and hard to overcook, so turn off heat and let natural release after cooking.

## Meat

Don't try to thicken sauces before cooking or it may burn, thicken after cooking. Browning the meat before cooking increases the flavor.
